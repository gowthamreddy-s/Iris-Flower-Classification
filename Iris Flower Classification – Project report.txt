Iris Flower Classification ‚Äì Project Summary

Problem Statement:
To classify iris flowers into one of three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using features like petal and sepal length and width.

Approach:
Loaded the classic Iris dataset using Scikit-learn.
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn‚Äôs pairplot and heatmaps to understand feature relationships.
Identified that petal dimensions were more predictive than sepal measurements.
Trained classification models using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree algorithms.
Used 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance more reliably.
Achieved an average cross-validated accuracy of 96.7%.

My Role:
I handled the complete pipeline‚Äîdata loading, visualization, model selection, training, evaluation, and interpretation of results. Also implemented cross-validation to ensure robustness.

üìä Interpretation:
KNN had slightly more consistent (stable) performance across folds.
Decision Tree was a bit more variable, but is easier to explain.
Both models are well-suited for the dataset due to its clean and separable structure.

‚úÖ Outcome / What I Learned:
Understood the power of EDA in revealing feature importance.
Learned how to compare models using cross-validation.
Realized that model performance should not be judged by accuracy alone, but also consistency and interpretability.s
Gained practical experience in working with a clean, classic dataset using scikit-learn.

üó£Ô∏è What You Can Say in an Interview:
I trained both KNN and Decision Tree models using 5-fold cross-validation. Both achieved the same average accuracy of around 96.7%, but KNN was slightly more stable. However, the Decision Tree is more interpretable, which is useful when explaining predictions to non-technical stakeholders.


Revision in short version

üéØ Aim of the Project:
To classify iris flowers into one of three species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) using their physical measurements like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

üîë Key Terms & Concepts Used in the Project:
Term	Definition
Iris Dataset	                           A classic dataset with 150 samples of iris flowers with 4 features and 3 classes
Features	                           The input variables (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width)
Target	                                   The class to predict ‚Äì the species of the iris flower
Label Encoding	                           Converting the species names into numerical labels (0, 1, 2)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)	           Analyzing the dataset visually using plots before modeling
Pairplot	                           A grid of scatter plots to visualize relationships between feature pairs
Heatmap                             	   A correlation matrix visualized to understand feature relationships
Correlation	                           A value between -1 and 1 that shows how strongly two variables are related
Train-Test Split	                   Dividing data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)	           A classification algorithm that predicts the class based on nearby neighbors
Decision Tree	                           A tree-structured classifier that splits data based on feature thresholds
Cross-Validation	                   A method to validate model performance over multiple data splits
Accuracy	                           The ratio of correctly predicted samples to total samples
Recall / Precision / F1-score	           Not critical here due to balanced data, but can be used if needed
Confusion Matrix	                   Matrix to compare predicted vs actual class labels

üìù What Happened at the End:
Both KNN and Decision Tree achieved high accuracy (~96.7%) on the dataset.
Cross-validation was used for more reliable performance measurement.
KNN was slightly more stable, but Decision Tree was easier to interpret.
The dataset was clean and small, so even simple models performed very well.
