# Iris-Flower-Classification

## Project Summary  
Classifies iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica using physical measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).  
Uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Tree classifiers with 5-fold cross-validation and achieves ~96.7% accuracy.

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed.  
2. Install dependencies:  

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the main script:  
 
 ```
python main.py
 ```

## Dataset  
Uses the classic Iris dataset from Scikit-learn.

## Model Performance
Both KNN and Decision Tree models achieved around 96.7% average accuracy using 5-fold cross-validation.
Final test accuracy reached 100% on both models.

## Project Details

- Explored feature relationships with pairplots and heatmaps.  
- KNN showed slightly more stable performance.  
- Decision Tree model is easier to explain to non-technical stakeholders.  
- Both models performed very well on this clean, classic dataset.

## What I Learned  
- Importance of exploratory data analysis (EDA) for feature insight.  
- Comparing models using cross-validation for robust evaluation.  
- Trade-offs between model accuracy, stability, and interpretability.
